# SMBC-with-ScotchIO
A simple smbc-comics.com scraper, based on [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js) tutorial.

## To install
Hopefully you already [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) installed on your computer. If so, it should be as simple as downloading this repository onto your computer, and typing `npm install`.

## To use
`npm start`

## Notes
- From my knowledge, it seems excessive to have to run an entire server in order to get the information I want. On the other hand, I wasn't having much luck in my Casperjs version of the scraper.
