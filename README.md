# SMBC-with-ScotchIO
A simple smbc-comics.com scraper, based on [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js) tutorial.

## To install
Hopefully you already [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) installed on your computer. If so, it should be as simple as downloading this repository onto your computer, and typing `npm install`.

## To use
`npm start`

## Notes
- From my knowledge, it seems **excessive to run a server** in order to get the information I want. ~~On the other hand, I wasn't having much luck in my Casperjs version of the scraper.~~
  - After some success in my [smbc-with-casperjs] (https://github.com/Kelvin-Lee/smbc-with-casperjs) repository, I am **more convinced** that the server is overkill in terms of overhead and extra code written, though still not conclusively sure.
